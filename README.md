# Advent of Code 2022

File names equal day and exercise.
The first two digits represent the day of the exercise.
The third digit represents the part of that day, for example the first or the second part.
For example: `./data/072input.txt` represents the input for the second part of the seventh day.

To calculate the result for day 1, exercise 2, run:

```bash
node ./src/012.js
```

The input for each day and exercise will be in the `./data` directory.
The output will be printed to `stdout`.

> ⚠️ Make sure the input file with the correct file name exists in the `./data` directory before you run the code.
